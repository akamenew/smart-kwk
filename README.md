This wordpress plugin is designed to make the affiliate management easier. It allows to verify payments through 
a third party service and approve the commission for the referrer. A built-in voucher system allows to import vouchers
from a CSV file and send a voucher to the approved referrer. The template used for the mail with the voucher can also 
be designed in the plugin with a full preview.
