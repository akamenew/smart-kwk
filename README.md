This wordpress plugin is designed to enhance the "AffiliateWP" plugin and to make the affiliate management easier for the customer needs. It allows to verify payments through a third party service and approve the commission for the referrer. A built-in voucher system allows to import vouchers from a CSV file and send a voucher to the approved referrer. The template used for the mail with the voucher can also be designed in the plugin with a full preview.
